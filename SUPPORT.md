### Asking quality questions

Help us help you!

Spending time framing a question and adding support links or resources makes it
much easier for us to help. Itâ€™s easy to fall into the trap of asking something 
too specific when youâ€™re close to a problem. Then, those trying to help you out 
have to spend a lot of time asking additional questions to understand what you 
are hoping to achieve.

Spending the extra time up front can help save everyone time in the long run.
