# Well known files

Welcome to the Well-known files project. This repository contains all well-known files you could find 
in a GitHub repository.

# Introduction
Besides code being tracked in a repository you typically find files which are
for documentation purposes. They explain something such as how to get started
, how to contribute or how to report security concerns.

These files usually are named in uppercase with and optional extension written 
in lowercase, e.g. `README.md` or `LICENSE`.

# Code owners
This file defines individuals or teams that are responsible for code in a repository.

Code owners are automatically requested for review when someone opens a pull request that modifies code that they own. 
When someone with admin or owner permissions has enabled required reviews, they also can optionally require approval 
from a code owner before the author can merge a pull request in the repository.

# Issue templates
When you add an issue template to your repository, project contributors will automatically see the template's contents 
in the issue body. Templates customize and standardize the information you'd like included when contributors open 
issues.

To add multiple issue templates to a repository create an ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ directory in your project root. Within that 
`ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory you can create as many issue templates as you need, for example `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bugs.md`.
